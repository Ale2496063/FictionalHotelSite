      <article id="primary">
		<p class="question">How did the Timey Wimey Inn become a hub for Whovians and all things Dr. Who?</p>
         <p class="answer">Well legend has it, that when the original Inn first opened its doors, a guest vanished and was not seen or heard from for years. Out of the blue, this guest reappeared and claimed to have traveled in time and partied with aliens. Truth be told, he got stuck in the basement and watched Dr. Who for the past 10 years until one of our employees discovered why our bread and wine inventory was not accurate.</p>
         <p class="question">What are the check-in and check-out times?</p>
         <p class="answer">Check-out time is 11am and check-in is between 1 and 5pm. Speak to the front desk staff if you have special circumstances.</p>
         <p class="question">In addition to your accommodations, what other services do you offer?</p>
         <p class="answer">The Timey Wimey Inn is the perfect place for a romantic getaway, a fully
            catered business meeting, or an event as special as a wedding. We do offer great room
            service food as well as a full service spa, both of which help our guests feel like they've
            come to the right place to get away from it all. </p>
         <p class="question">Do you have a pool?</p>
         <p class="answer">Like all hotels we too have a pool, but ours is actually quite unique. You'll just have to see it to believe it.</p>
         <p class="question">Do you accept AAA discounts, or other discount cards?</p>
         <p class="answer">No we don't accept any discount cards, but that doesn't mean 
            we don't have discount prices on our rooms. We do offer different kinds 
            of specials, some seasonal, some for senior, just for returning guests, etc. Visit 
            the events page on this Web site to see if any special discounts are currently 
            in effect, or just call our reservations desk.</p>
